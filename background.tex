\subsection{Distributed Databases}
\rewrite{\textbf{Paragraph's purpose: what are they? What need were they initially trying to fill that SMDBs could not?}}

\rewrite{\textbf{Paragraph (or two)'s purpose: why are they so bad at performance?}}

\rewrite{\textbf{Paragraph's purpose: list the use case under which distributed databases work really well aka partitionable workloads in which all partitions receive roughly equal load.}}

\subsection{Skew}
