\section{Introduction}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\rewrite{Big, overarching statement about distributed databases (scalable, fault tolerant, available). Big overarching statement about single machine db's (good performance). Mention strict strict serializability. Mention workload skew, why workload skew matters \cite{fbphotocaching, fblinchpin}.}

\rewrite{The problem we try to solve is sustaining throughput for skewed, non-partitionable workloads in distributed databases. Mention how most databases perform poorly from workload skew (I really wish I finished instrumenting so I could quantitatively identify the reasons), both in distributed settings and in single machine settings. Intuitively, it's due to bottlenecking on the hotkey, contention (mention 2PC, OCC, locks). Exacerbated by strong consistency model \cite{tapir}.}

\rewrite{How people generally solve that problem. In distributed settings: partitioning \cite{partionskewpavlo, slog}, which doesn't work for non-partitionable workloads. Weakening the consistency model \cite{dynamo}, but now you're not consistent. Live with the low throughput \cite{calvin, spanner, cockroachdb}...but, well, now you have low throughput. 

In single machine settings, things perform better \cite{mocc, cicada, ermia}, but now you're not distributed anymore, so goodbye to scalability (and fault tolerance).} \jenndebug{This is the perfect place to put the graph that Wyatt suggested, shows where Thermopylae falls amongst all the other options.}

In this paper, we introduce Thermopylae, a distributed database that sustains throughput at three orders of magnitude higher than existing state of the art for non-partitionable, skewed workloads. It employs a novel distributed architecture that embeds a single machine DB into a distributed DB. This architecture dramatically increases throughput by exploiting workload skew to leverage single machine DB performance benefits. \rewrite{More rawr rawr we are awesome sentences.}

\rewrite{Here's a paragraph about embedding SMDBs into distributed DBs. I'm going to lift this from my thesis. Hello Silo \cite{silo}, hello CockroachDB \cite{cockroachdb}. State some applications, of which I have none.

Here's another paragraph about the protocol. Hello strict serializability, hello 2PC, hello MVCC, hello OCC. Probably throw in Rococo \cite{rococo} for good measure. State some benefits, of which I also have not yet thought of.}

We present the following contributions in this paper:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel distributed architecture that embeds a single machine DB into a distributed DB. The architecture exploits workload skew to leverage \unseenabbrv{SMDB} performance for increasing throughput \true{by several orders of magnitude}.
    \item An accompanying concurrency control and commit protocol that further improves throughput by \jenndebug{preventing bottlenecks (this is passive wording, need active wording)} on the \unseenabbrv{hotshard}. It also enforces the \true{strongest consistency model (is this actually still considered the strongest? I read somewhere that there was now a stronger one, but alas I forget the paper)}, strict serializability, by coordinating the executions of two independent databases.
    \item \true {Thermopylae, a distributed database capable of sustaining throughput on the same order of magnitude as its SMDB counterparts--around three orders of magnitude higher than existing state of the art distributed databases.}
\end{itemize}
