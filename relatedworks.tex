\subsubsection{Cicada}
\textbf{Main point}: Cicada \cite{cicada} uses OCC + MVCC and its concurrency control protocol. It notes that OCC performs poorly during contention, before reads are always aborted for the sake of writes. Long-lived reads that access a contentious key frequently abort. It uses MVCC to prevent txns from being aborted from reads not validating (aka reads can read previous version while another txn writes, and reads will spin wait on a pending write, depending on the timestamp). Also uses "best effort inlining," "contention aware back off," and a smattering of other techniques that I read about and then forget. Uses loosely synchronized clocks per thread, they synchronize ad hoc with their neighbors, and Cicada hopes that they're all roughly caught up to each other.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Relevance to us}: we may use it in place of Silo. 
    \item \textbf{Does well}: It uses a LOT of optimizations: best-effort inlining to save memory (version attempts to use pre-allocated space), installing writes uses atomic compare and swap, "contention aware validation" uses latest wts to determine contention and orders writes, some special garbage collection based on timestamps). It also performs comparatively well in write-intensive, contentions (zipf const = 0.99) workloads. Does better than Silo, TicToc, Hekaton, Ermia, Foedus.
    \item\textbf{Can improve}: Besides the write-intensive skewed workload, throughput improvements are not significant. The lines are barely apart. I also remember noting to myself the first time that when I describe a protocol, I would not write it like that.  
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Hekaton}
\textbf{Main point}: Hekaton\cite{hekaton} is Microsoft's OLTP engine for its DBMS, SQL Server. It uses MVCC, is latch free, and it seems to be famous, b/c it looks like it is one of the first main memory DBs in production.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Relevance to us}: Unclear. I read it because it is mentioned as a baseline in a lot of the SMDB papers, so it seems to a conventional default.
    \item \textbf{Did well}: being first?
    \item \textbf{Can improve}: its performance seems pretty poor compared to say, Silo (published at the same time).
\end{itemize}
